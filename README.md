## Minimalist rich text editor
This is a rich text editor built with Tauri using Rust and Javascript. I originally developed this project because I write fictional novels as a side hobby and I need a tool to organize my writings. But after witnessing the potential of Tauri, I've decided to build a rich text editor instead.

I'm ashamed to say that at this stage, this software isn't even functional; many fundamental features are still missing such as read/write files and basic styling options. But hopefully these will be added in the not so distant future.
