## Minimalist rich text editor
This is a rich text editor built with Tauri using Rust and Javascript. I originally developed this project because I write fictional novels as a side hobby and I need a tool to organize my writings. But after witnessing the potential of Tauri, I've decided to build a rich text editor instead.
